# Recover-Drive
- This tool is intended to be used by a technician who has a user that is unable to unlock their drive that is encrypted by BitLocker. The user may have the drive password protected and has forgotten the password or their certificates on their smart card are no longer valid because they recently got a new smart card issued to them. With this tool you'll be able to unlock the drive (given you have access to the BitLocker recovery key) and assign a temporary password that the user will be able to change in the future.
